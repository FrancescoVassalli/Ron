GetNames.sh - runs over all the desired files and puts their names in a Combined text file.  Doesn't Move them
Compling - compile the sh files with chmod -x "Filename" run them with bash "Filename" 
GetAllHists.C - code for getting any TObject out of the files with an example of the syntax in the main uses the Combined text file generated by the sh's
